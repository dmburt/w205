HOSPITALS AND PATIENTS

SUMMARY:
Using post-operative complication rate scores as a proxy for overall hospital quality,
I calculated the per-hospital average score for complications, weighted by denominator,
to account for higher opportunity/risk associated with performing a higher number of 
surgical procedures.  I used a Pearson Product Moment correlation of this hospital-
level weighted quality score with the hospitals' overall CAHPS Star rating to assess
the degree to which higher quality is related to overall patient satisfaction with a
hospital.

BEST STATES

SUMMARY:
Using post-operative complication rate scores as a proxy for overall hospital quality,
I aggregated the per-hospital average score to a state level for complications, 
weighted by denominator, to account for higher opportunity/risk associated with performing 
a higher number of surgical procedures.  It was important to use a similar methodology to
the one I used at the hospital level, to ensure consistency.
